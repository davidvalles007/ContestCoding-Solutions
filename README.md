# ContestCoding-Solutions
TL;DR - This repo contains most of the solutions to challenges hosted on https://contestcoding.wordpress.com/  Back in 2013 when I was learning how to code in Python, I used to look for challenges and mundane tasks which I can then try to automate or solve by writing code in Python. This was to push myself to get better with Python and write some purpose driven code. In this quest, I came across https://contestcoding.wordpress.com/. I submitted solutions to many of the challenges and eventually finished in the Top 5 on the Leaderboard. This repository contains most of the solutions.    Disclaimer: I am not a python expert. I tried to be pythonic with the code wherever possible. Keeping in mind the time constraint I had, all of the code was written to find the solution as quick as possible.
